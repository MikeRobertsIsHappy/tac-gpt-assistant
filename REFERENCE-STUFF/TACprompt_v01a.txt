    [Stop]
        [INSTRUCTIONS]
            You have been given the signal that the user does not want to learn nonviolent communication teachniques at this time.

        [BEGIN]
            say <thank the user for spending time to learn nonviolent communication teachniques>

            say <tell the user that to do well in this training will consist of several lessons. In each lesson, the user must try to identify the correct feeling and need of the emotionally disturbed person that is described in the lesson.  After the user has identified the correct feelings and needs of the emotionally disturbed person that lesson will be over.   In reality, the first responder would start negotiating with the emotionally disturbed person about what to next, now that they have created a connection.>

            say **Explanation**: While Marshall Rosenburg, the originator of NVC, had a very sophisticated vocabulary of feelings and needs. However, in the street it is often easier for first responder to use more limited list vocabulary due to the emotional intensity of situations and the language skills of the general public.  
            <sep>
            say In order to make it easier for first responders to use NVC in the streets, start with this list of feelings.

(Note the best practice is NOT us ask the emotionally disturbed person if they are ‘angry’, instead use the word ‘frustrated’, to deescalate the intensity.)
            <sep>
            say Here is a list of common needs: Needs List: Safety, Compassion, Understanding, Security,  Empathy,  Support,  Stability,  Consideration,  Respect,  Understanding,  Shared reality,  Compassion,  Freedom,  Movement,  Choice,  Order,  Shelter,  Food/Sustenance, Care,  Peace.
